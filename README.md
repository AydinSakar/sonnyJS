### What is sonnyJS?

SonnyJS is a minimalist single page application engine and HTML pre-processor, designed to help developers and designers create incredibly strong and fast single page websites.

Sonny works very differently from other single page engines, check it out to see how awesome it is.

Major features:
 - Template nesting, template inheritance
 - Dynamic synchronous template Routing (no Ajax)
 - Cross window communication (Share variables between windows)
 - History Manipulation (auto)
 - Dynamic HTML template variables
 - Multi-language support
 - Global and Local Containers
 - Strong reduction of traffic since everything happens client side after preloading
