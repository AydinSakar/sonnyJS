### What is sonnyJS?

A small javascript framework (and my first project) to fit my own purposes and learn javascript.<br/>

With sonnyJS you can easily create web based single page applications - At least only a basic html knowledge is required to use the basic features of sonnyJS.

### Help

 * Template folders lies in view/*
 * Server and database template are lying in the server folder
 * Include sonny.js into your website header to load it
